Hello! Thanks for visiting my blog. My name is Jason McDermott and I studied music and visual arts in college, but somewhere along the way found my way into programming as a profession. The name of this blog comes from a lyric I penned (a very long time ago, in a band all-but-forgotten). Though it's kind of a play on words, it hints at my approach to life and technology. I believe - or at least hope - we're all curious by nature, and therefore by design.

I am currently a Senior Software Developer at [Rightpoint Consulting](https://www.rightpoint.com/). I'm also a father, avid film-goer and occasional lap-swimmer. I should note that all opinions expressed on this site are mine alone and do not represent those of my employer.
